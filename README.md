# Project Description
Project ‘Gazua’ is a Qt GUI application which supports cryptomarket investing activities such as buying, selling, searching via Korbit API.
We decided to use Qt5, especially Qt Quick2 for our project. We also decided to use Qt’s Model-View-Delegate design pattern for this project.
